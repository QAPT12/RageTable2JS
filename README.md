# RageTable2JS
Second version of the Wild Magic Rage table for my barbarian character in D&amp;D using Javascript

will Read from a text file and split each line into a different element in an array. The lines in the text file are different effects for the wild magic barbarians 
wild surge on rage.

This automates having to roll dice and look up on a table which effect to run, and also allows for a weird number of effects.
